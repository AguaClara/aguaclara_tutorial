If the turbidimeter reads dessicant, the dessicant needs to be changed. When looking down on the turbidimeter from the top there are four silver screws, one on each corner. When these are removed the entire top of the turbidimeter including vial and display can be lifted. It is inside this compartment that the desiccants are located. The desiccants are important because they keep the compartment with the turbidimeter vials dry. A humid chamber can cause condensation on vials that will give false readings.
When this occurs bring the desiccant back to Hollister room 150 and leave it in the heating oven overnight at 100ºF. This will regenerate the desiccant and it will become active again.

Colab and Github Workflow
=========================
A Colab notebook can be opened from Github, but it will open in Colab as a new read-only version rather than the original notebook.

To illustrate, here is an example notebook created in Colab:

.. image:: images/Colab-Original.png
    :align: center
    :width: 500

Here is a copy of the notebook saved to an example Github repository:

.. image:: images/Colab-Github.png
    :align: center
    :width: 500

And here is the read-only copy that results from clicking the "Open in Colab" link in Github:

.. image:: images/Colab-Read-Only.png
    :align: center
    :width: 500

Hence, the best way to work on a notebooks and keep it updated on Github is to **open it from Google Drive and save a copy to Github each time you are finished working**. This should be your workflow:

1. Create a notebook in Google Colab.
2. Work on your notebook.
3. Save a copy to your team's Github repository and close the notebook.
4. Open the notebook from Google Drive.
5. Return to step 2.

Collaboration in Colab
======================

Unfortunately, Colab is not short for Collaboration. Colab notebooks can be shared with other users and opened by multiple users at a time. If one person makes a change, the others will be able to see the change after a short delay. *However*, if two people edit the document at the same time, one person's changes must be discarded upon refreshing.

There are a few options for collaboration among your subteam. The most basic method is for different members to work on the notebook at separate times. You may also work in separate copies of the notebook and manually merge your edits. Lastly, you are welcome to use another editor/IDE that does support real-time collaboration, such as Atom, as long as you save your work to Github in the form of IPython/Jupyter/Colab notebooks.

What is Toggl?
==============

Toggl is a web-based time tracking tool that allows the user to log time spent on any task at the click of a button. Toggl can be used on a variety of devices from Windows computers to iPhones. With Toggl, you'll be able to easily log your weekly 10 hours anywhere on the web!

The reason we chose Toggl is because of its user-friendly interface and neat team management capabilities. With this tool, we'll be able to make sure that you (and the leadership team) are able to get an accurate picture of how many hours you **really** spend on AguaClara tasks each week without having to manually fill in our old log book spreadsheet. Instead, Toggl will automatically track your hours for you and all you have to do is fill in a description of what you are doing and click a button to start the timer.

Toggl Organization
==================

Toggl has an organization system that consists of a "Team" of users and individual "Projects" under that overarching "Team" of which corresponding users are a part of.

The way our Toggl team is organized is:


* **Everyone** is a part of the AguaClara "Team"
* **Subteam Members** are each a part of their own [insert Subteam Name] "Project" under the AguaClara "Team"

A visual representation of the structure:

First Things First
==================

Below are the first steps you should be taking to get yourself set up with a working Toggl account under the overarching AguaClara team and your respective subteam.

Creating an Account
-------------------

Once you are added to our Toggl team, you'll receive an **email in your Cornell inbox with an activation link**. This link will take you to the registration page. Go ahead and **register on this page**.

After you've registered, you should automatically be added to the AguaClara Toggl Team. You can check this at the bottom left corner. If you are in the AguaClara workspace, AguaClara should appear under your name. Otherwise, click your name and AguaClara should show up under "Workspaces".

Finding Your Subteam
--------------------

After registering, you will be added to your subteam "Project". You can find your subteam "Project" by clicking "Projects" under "Manage" on the left sidebar. You will only be able to see your own subteam on the "Projects" page.

If you click into your subteam name, your page should look like this:

On this page, you can:


#. Check your subteam's total hours by clicking the pie chart at the top right.
#. Look at who's on your team by clicking into the "Team" tab.

Download the Chrome Extension
-----------------------------

To make your life easier, we'll be having everyone download the Toggl Button Chrome Extension. Take a minute to `get it now <https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/toggl-button-productivity/oejgccbfbmkkpaidnkphaiaecficdnfn>`_.

Logging Your Hours
==================

Now, we get to the meat of the tutorial! We'll go over how to log your hours on the Toggl website and with the Toggl Button for Chrome.

Toggl Website
-------------

Once you log into Toggl, you should immediately be on the "Timer" page. This is where you will log your hours on the website. It's also where you'll see your previous time logs listed for the selected time period.

Once you're about to **start a new task**\ , follow these steps to start tracking your time:


#. 
   Make sure you are on "Timer Mode".

   :alt: Workspace and Project Selection GIF



#. 
   Click the green play icon to start tracking time and start working.

#. 
   When you're finished with the task, click the red stop button to stop tracking time. The task should appear on your activity log.

If your mom calls and you have to stop your task for a minute, stop tracking your time while you take that call. To **continue your previous task**\ , hover over your latest submission and click the play button that appears.

Toggl Button for Chrome
-----------------------

The Toggl Button should appear as a grey power icon :raw-html-m2r:`<img src="https://goo.gl/y21RF2" width="30">`
on your extensions toolbar in Chrome. If you click on that :raw-html-m2r:`<img src="https://goo.gl/y21RF2" width="30">` button, you'll be given the option to "Start New" or "Continue Latest" and a list of your "Recent Entries".

To **start a new task**\ :


#. Click on "Start New".

   :alt: Writing Description with Button GIF



#. 
   Click "Done". *The grey Toggl button should now be red.*

#. 
   When you're finished with the task, click on the Toggl button, hover over your task and click "Stop".

To **continue your previous task**\ , click "Continue Latest" and Toggl will immediately start tracking your time again.

Cool, what else can I do on Toggl?
==================================

Github Integration
------------------

Toggl makes your life easier in so many ways. One of those ways is being easily accessible from a wide selection of websites! We're going to be using a lot of Github in AguaClara, so here we'll talk about how we can give Toggl permission to appear in Github issues.


#. 
   Click on the Toggl button in Chrome and open up settings. You should be in the "Permissions" tab now.

#. 
   Scroll through the websites and click on github&#46;com OR if you're feeling like you want Toggl on absolutely everything possible... just click "Enable All".

Tada! Now you should be able to see the lovely red Toggl button in Github when you open up an issue.

Dashboard
---------

One of the coolest features about Toggl is the "Dashboard" interface. On the Dashboard, you can see a detailed report of what you've been working on this week and for how long, as well as what your team has been working on. For subteam leads, this feature will be incredibly helping in managing accountability of each member of the team. But in general, this is a great way for any team member to get a better idea of whether or not they are putting in the appropriate amount of time into work for the team.

You can toggle (ha! pun intended) between "Me" and "Team" on the Dashboard.

The "Me" page will allow you to look at your log times for the selected time period and your most tracked activities.

The "Team" page will show total log times for the selected time period, the most active members on the time, and list recent activity.

Toggl Everywhere
================

You can get Toggl on a variety of platforms:


* Toggl Button Chrome Extension
* Toggl Button Firefox Extension
* Desktop App (Windows, Mac, Linux)
* Mobile App (iOS, Android)

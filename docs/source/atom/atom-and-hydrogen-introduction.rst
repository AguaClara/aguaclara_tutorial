What is Atom?
=============

**"A hackable text editor for the 21st Century."** *- Atom's slogan*

Atom is a popular and highly customizable text file editor, most commonly used to write code.

Text Editor vs. IDE
-------------------

Programmers choose to write their code in one of two kinds of programs, each with different features:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Text Editor
     - IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
   * - Like `Notepad++ <https://notepad-plus-plus.org/>`_
     - Like `Eclipse <https://www.eclipse.org/>`_
   * - Fast
     - Run code in the IDE
   * - Takes up less space
     - Restructure messy code
   * -
     - Check code syntax
   * -
     - *And many more...*


Atom starts out as a blazingly fast text editor with unlimited customization. Because of that, you can install exactly how many plug-ins you need to add features that are normally unique to IDE's, allowing you to strike the balance between a text editor and an IDE.

Why use Atom?
-------------

* Atom works well with `Git <https://git-scm.com/>`_ and
  `Github <https://github.com/>`_\ , which serve a similar purpose as Google Drive, but for code.
* Atom is open source, fulfilling AguaClara's commitment to open source
  technology.
* Atom can be automatically customized to be ready for use in AguaClara.
* Atom lets you collaborate with other team members on the same document in
  real time, much like with Google Drive.

We've omitted an Atom-specific tutorial because it's so easy to use. But if you want to learn more about Atom, check out the `Atom Flight Manual <http://flight-manual.atom.io/getting-started/sections/why-atom/>`_.

**An Atom package that lets you run Python code within Markdown files.**

If you have previous experience with Jupyter Notebooks, you'll find many of the same features with Hydrogen:

* Running code interactively
* Checking data from experiments
* Performing calculations
* Drawing data plots

Why use Hydrogen?
-----------------
* Hydrogen allows you to complement the information in your reports with Python code.
* Hydrogen and Python are open source, fulfilling AguaClara's devotion to open source software.

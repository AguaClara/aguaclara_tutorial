Git and GitHub Introduction
***************************

What are Git and GitHub?
========================

**Software tools for storing files in the cloud, keeping track of their changes, and organizing tasks among team members.**

Much of the work done in AguaClara is collaborative, so we need to be able to share our work across different members and subteams. To accomplish this, we use two popular technologies: Git and Github.

**Git** is a Version Control System (VCS). Git allows you to have fine control over the changes you make to your files and revert any changes if necessary. Also, it allows you to make different "versions" of your files and edit them separately from each other.

**Github** is a cloud storage service for the files that you maintain with Git. The basic functions of Git on your computer can also be used online at github.com. Additionally, Github offers collaborative tools for managing tasks within a subteam, discussing issues and problems, and accepting edits to your files. It also can host wikis, like the one you're reading right now!

Git is not Github!
------------------

**Just like how a jellyfish is not a fish.**

A common misconception is that Git and Github are the same thing because of the similar names. However, there are key differences between the two software tools:

.. TODO: make this a table.

* **Git** lives on your computer's command line and gives you a lot of control over managing the files that you edit.
* **Github** is an online service that mainly stores the files that you manage; it doesn't offer as much control over them, though.
* **Git** uploads and synchronizes the files you edit on your computer with files stored online on Github.
* **Github** works as its own website to offer project management tools that complement your files.

It's important to make this distinction between Git and Github to fully understand how each software tool works on its own.

Why not use Google Drive?
-------------------------

Git and Github have collaborative tools similar to those of Google Drive, but also support editing Markdown files. Markdown files are very powerful in that you can run Python code within research reports, something that Google Drive doesn't offer. Furthermore, Atom Teletype provides the same real-time editing that Google Drive offers, if you need to work on something with your teammates at the same time.

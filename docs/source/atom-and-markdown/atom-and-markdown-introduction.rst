**"A hackable text editor for the 21st Century."** *- Atom's slogan*

Atom is a popular and highly customizable text file editor, most commonly used to write code.

Text Editor vs. IDE
-------------------

Programmers choose to write their code in one of two kinds of programs, each with different features:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Text Editor
     - IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
   * - Like `Notepad++ <https://notepad-plus-plus.org/>`_
     - Like `Eclipse <https://www.eclipse.org/>`_
   * - Fast
     - Run code in the IDE
   * - Takes up less space
     - Restructure messy code
   * - 
     - Check code syntax
   * - 
     - *And many more...*


Atom starts out as a blazingly fast text editor with unlimited customization. Because of that, you can install exactly how many plug-ins you need to add features that are normally unique to IDE's, allowing you to strike the balance between a text editor and an IDE.

Why use Atom?
-------------

* Atom works well with `Git <https://git-scm.com/>`_ and
  `Github <https://github.com/>`_\ , which serve a similar purpose as Google Drive, but for code.
* Atom is open source, fulfilling AguaClara's commitment to open source
  technology.
* Atom can be automatically customized to be ready for use in AguaClara.
* Atom lets you collaborate with other team members on the same document in
  real time, much like with Google Drive.

We've omitted an Atom-specific tutorial because it's so easy to use. But if you want to learn more about Atom, check out the `Atom Flight Manual <http://flight-manual.atom.io/getting-started/sections/why-atom/>`_.

What is Markdown?
=================

**A text file format that is easy to use and read - perfect for research reports!**

Markdown is derived from **HTML**, which makes up much of the websites you visit on a daily basis. Because of that, Markdown is used to format user-submitted content on many websites, like Github.

Why use Markdown?
-----------------

* Markdown is *easy to read*, even when unformatted.
* Markdown is an *open source format*, unlike Microsoft Word. Anyone can
  create and edit Markdown files without paying for software, fulfilling
  AguaClara's devotion to open source software.
* Markdown is *easy to write*. You won't have to worry about line spacing,
  margins, or anything else that makes Word documents difficult to use!

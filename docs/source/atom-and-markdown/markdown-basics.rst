Using Markdown
==============

We'll be using **Atom** to edit Markdown files and preview them nicely:

#. Open **Atom** and open the ``aguaclara_tutorial/`` repository folder that
   you cloned (or any other project folder you have).
#. Click on one of the ``*.md`` files in the left Project pane to open it.
#. Press ``Ctrl + Shift + M`` to open a formatted preview on the right.

   * If a preview didn't show up, review the instructions on :ref:`installing-on-macos` or :ref:`installing-on-windows`.

All Markdown files must be **text files with the** ``.md`` **file extension**. All of the text files within the ``aguaclara_tutorial`` repository are already Markdown files.

Basic Text
----------

.. code-block:: md

   Regular text comes out normally.

   Leave an empty line between paragraphs.

Code Formatting
---------------

   apostrophe (') !

   ```
   To make a block of formatted code, begin and end your code with triple backticks.
   ```

   ```python
   def foo():
       print("Add the name of your programming language after the first triple backticks to add syntax highlighting.")
   ```

LaTeX Formatting
================

In Atom, ``Ctrl + Shift + M`` will automatically display LaTeX formatted equations within Markdown files. They won't show up on this wiki page, but try pasting this line into a Markdown file in Atom:

.. code-block:: md

   $$ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 $$

Please refer to `this LaTeX tutorial <https://www.latex-tutorial.com/tutorials/amsmath/>`_ to learn how to write equations.

**Now, complete Lesson 1 of the interactive tutorials. It's in the**
``Interactive-Tutorial-1-Markdown.md`` **file in your** ``aguaclara_tutorial``
**repository.**

Why install these software tools?
=================================

**These software tools make it easier for you to conduct research and convey your findings to the rest of the team.**

Computer programming has played a crucial role in the work that AguaClara does, and not just in the Apps & Algorithms teams! Research and fabrication teams benefit greatly from writing simple code to run hydraulic calculations. Furthermore, code is a great way to make your research reports interactive and intuitive. Don't worry if you've never written a line of code before - this tutorial with teach you everything you need to know.

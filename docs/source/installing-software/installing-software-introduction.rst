What do I need to install?
==========================

There are a few pieces of software that you'll need to install before beginning work on AguaClara:

  * Sync Settings : for making your Atom settings and plug-ins ready for AguaClara development.

* Git : for maintaining and uploading your code to GitHub.
* Anaconda : for installing/maintaining Python and its packages.

  * Python : for running your code.
  * ``pip`` : `for installing Python packages <https://pypi.org/project/pip/>`_\ (collections of code with useful functions)

    * The ``aguaclara`` Python package.
* Interactive Tutorials : for practice with using these pieces of software.

Why install these software tools?
=================================

**These software tools make it easier for you to conduct research and convey your findings to the rest of the team.**

Computer programming has played a crucial role in the work that AguaClara does, and not just in the Apps & Algorithms teams! Research and fabrication teams benefit greatly from writing simple code to run hydraulic calculations. Furthermore, code is a great way to make your research reports interactive and intuitive. Don't worry if you've never written a line of code before - this tutorial with teach you everything you need to know.

In this tutorial, we'll show how to graph data and a linear regression line from both a few manually entered data points (e.g. fluoride probe calibration data) and a spreadsheet (e.g. a data file generated by ProCoDA).

Regardless of the data we're graphing, we'll need to import the following libraries (using `as ` to give some of our libraries "nicknames"):

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
from scipy import stats
#import pandas as pd
```

### Graphing from Manually Entered Data Points

Create a [list](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_lists.htm) of data points, where each data point is a list of two numbers so that the first number is your x-coordinate and the second number is your y-coordinate.

We make our list into a [Numpy array](http://cs231n.github.io/python-numpy-tutorial/#numpy-arrays) so it is easier to slice. (Jump to the section on multidimensional slicing of Numpy arrays [here](https://scipy-cookbook.readthedocs.io/items/Indexing.html).)

To obtain just the x-coordinates, slice the list created above to get the first element of each data point. Do the same thing operation for the y-coordinate, using the second element instead. Store both in separate variables.

```python
# Example data points. Add as many of your own data points as necessary.
data_points = np.array([[1,3],
                       [2,5],
                       [3,7],
                       [4,8],
                       [5,11],
                       [6,14]])

x_points = data_points[:,0]
y_points = data_points[:,1]
```
You can call Numpy math operations on the entire x-coordinate and y-coordinate arrays. For example, if you want to graph the calculation of x and y<sup>2</sup> or log(y), edit the line of code with `y_points` as follows, and every element of y will be transformed:

```python
#Squared
y_points = np.power(data_points[:,1], 2)
#Logarithm
y_points = np.log10(data_points[:,1])

```

The next step is to plot the graph. We initialize the [linear regression](http://www.statisticssolutions.com/what-is-linear-regression/) with linreg, with each x and y point, and store the beginning [index](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-list-index/) in the start [variable](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_variables.asp), then the last index in the end variable. plt.plot   

```python
linreg = stats.linregress(x_points, y_points)
slope, intercept, r_value = linreg[0:3]

start = 0 # Change as desired
end = x_points[-1] # last element; change as desired
plt.plot(x_points, y_points, 'o')
plt.plot(np.arange(start,end+1), np.arange(start,end+1)*slope + intercept)
plt.xlabel('X Label')
plt.ylabel('Y label')
plt.title('Title')
plt.minorticks_on()
plt.grid(which = 'major')
plt.grid(which = 'minor')
plt.show()

print("Slope:", slope)
print("Intercept:", intercept)
print("R-squared:", r_value ** 2)
```
